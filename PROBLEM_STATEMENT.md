# Load Balancer - Machine Coding Round

## Problem Statement

Design and implement a simple load balancer that distributes incoming client requests across multiple backend servers. The load balancer should be able to handle multiple clients simultaneously and ensure efficient distribution of load.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Basic Load Balancing**
   - Accept client connections on a specified port
   - Forward client requests to backend servers
   - Return responses from backend servers to clients
   - Handle multiple client connections simultaneously

2. **Load Balancing Strategies**
   - Implement at least one load balancing algorithm (e.g., Round Robin)
   - The system should be extensible to support multiple strategies
   - Strategy selection should be configurable

3. **Server Management**
   - Maintain a list of backend servers
   - Handle server failures gracefully
   - Support dynamic addition/removal of servers
   - Basic health checking of servers

4. **Connection Handling**
   - Maintain persistent connections with backend servers
   - Handle connection timeouts
   - Properly close connections when done
   - Handle connection failures gracefully

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Scalability
- How will your system handle a large number of concurrent connections?
- Consider the impact of adding more backend servers
- Think about memory usage with multiple connections

### 2. Performance
- How will you ensure minimal latency in request forwarding?
- Consider the overhead of load balancing algorithms
- Think about efficient data transfer between client and server

### 3. Reliability
- How will you handle server failures?
- Consider connection timeouts and retries
- Think about data consistency during failures

### 4. Thread Safety
- How will you handle concurrent connections?
- Consider thread synchronization
- Think about resource sharing between threads

### 5. Extensibility
- How will you make it easy to add new load balancing strategies?
- Consider the design patterns you'll use
- Think about the interface design

### 6. Error Handling
- How will you handle various error scenarios?
- Consider network failures
- Think about invalid requests

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Code Quality**
   - Clean, readable, and maintainable code
   - Proper error handling
   - Good use of design patterns
   - Appropriate comments and documentation

2. **Design**
   - Modular and extensible architecture
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Proper use of interfaces and abstractions
   - Scalable design decisions

3. **Implementation**
   - Working load balancing functionality
   - Proper handling of concurrent connections
   - Efficient resource management
   - Robust error handling

4. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Test coverage for edge cases
   - Proper mocking of external dependencies

## Bonus Points

1. **Additional Features**
   - Implement multiple load balancing strategies
   - Add server health monitoring
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Add metrics collection

2. **Advanced Concepts**
   - Implement circuit breaker pattern
   - Add support for SSL/TLS
   - Implement request/response transformation
   - Add logging and monitoring

## Time Limit

- 2-3 hours

## Tech Stack

- Language: Java
- Build Tool: Maven
- Testing: JUnit, Mockito
- No external libraries for load balancing

## Notes

1. Focus on core functionality first
2. Write clean, maintainable code
3. Add proper error handling
4. Include basic documentation
5. Write unit tests for critical functionality
6. Consider edge cases and failure scenarios

## Submission

1. Working code with proper documentation
2. Unit tests
3. README with setup and running instructions
4. Brief explanation of design decisions and trade-offs

## Discussion Points

Be prepared to discuss:
1. Your design decisions and trade-offs
2. How you handled concurrent connections
3. Your approach to error handling
4. How you would scale the solution
5. Potential improvements and optimizations
